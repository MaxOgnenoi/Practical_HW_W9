        The worst-case time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of words in the phrase. It means the execution
        time increases linearly with the number of words.

        The algorithm sorts a list of elements by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong
        order. It uses nested loops to iterate over the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if
        necessary. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. As there are two nested loops, the time
        complexity becomes quadratic.

        The worst-case time complexity for the given factorial function is O(n), where n is the input number. It
        means that the time taken by the algorithm to execute will increase linearly with the input number.

        The algorithm calculates the factorial of a given number recursively. If the input number is 0, it returns 1
        as the base case. Otherwise, it multiplies the input number by the factorial of (n-1) and recursively calls
        the factorial function with a smaller number. This process continues until the base case is reached. Since
        each recursive call reduces the input by 1, the algorithm has a linear time complexity.

        The function checks if the first element of the 'people' array is equal to the string 'bob'. Since accessing
        the first element of an array can be done in constant time, the function has a constant time complexity. It
        does not matter how many elements are in the array; the execution time remains the same.

        The worst-case time complexity for the given isPalindrome function is O(n), where n is the length of the
        input string. It means the execution time increases linearly with the length of the input. The function uses
        a stack to reverse the input string and then compares it with the original input to determine if it is a
        palindrome.

        The worst-case time complexity for the given sumOfDivisors function is O(n), where n is the input number. It
        means that the execution time increases linearly with the input number.

        The function calculates the sum of all the divisors of a given number by iterating through all numbers from
        1 to (n-1). For each number, it checks if it is a divisor of the input number. If it is, the number is added
        to the result. The loop iterates until it reaches the input number. Since the number of iterations depends
        on the input number, the time complexity is linear.

        The time complexity of the given printAllNumbersThenSumPairs function is O(n), where n is the length of the
        numArray. It means the execution time increases linearly with the size of the input array. The function
        prints all the numbers in the array individually and then calculates and prints the sum of adjacent pairs of
        numbers.
    </li>

        The worst-case time complexity for the given isPrime function is O(n), where n is the input number. It means
        that the execution time increases linearly with the input number.

        The function checks if a given number is prime by iterating from 2 to (num - 1) and checking if num is
        divisible by any number within that range. If a divisor is found, it returns false, indicating that the
        number is not prime. If no divisor is found, it returns true, indicating that the number is prime.

        The loop iterates (num - 2) times, so the time complexity is linear. In the worst-case scenario, when num is
        a prime number, the loop will run (num - 2) times, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
